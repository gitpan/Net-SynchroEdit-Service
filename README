Net-SynchroEdit-Service version 0.039
============================

The Net::SynchroEdit::Service module is used to interact with and manipulate existing SynchroEdit servers.
The module focuses on the core functionality, i.e. the ability to connect to/disconnect from existing response services, querying commands and fetching results, etc.

The Net::SynchroEdit::Session module can be used to represent a session within a response service. The Net::SynchroEdit::Controller module can be used for additional functionality.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note: 'make test' will fail horribly unless you have a running SynchroEdit server on the default port (7962) on localhost. If such a set up is impossible, simply ignore the test resuls or mod the test scripts.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  IO::Select
  IO::Socket
